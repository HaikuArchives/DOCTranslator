# Current problems

* Translator does not show up in DataTranslations (or work at all), but makes it crash on exit
* Substituted B_DOC_FORMAT for 99
* Debug alerts are not shown at all
* Makefile only works if haiku source was cloned to ~/haiku and the files are located in src/add-ons/translators/doc
